Whiteneon's DS1904 Example sketch.

The Dallas/Maxim 1-Wire iButton DS1904 is a neat little piece of hardware.

It is an iButton that contains a 32-bit RTC with 1-second resolution.

This example sketch demonstrates the ds1904 by combining it with the time library and use the rtc to track time using the unix epoch as a reference point.
